## Introduction
The Living the Simple Life website is a project that I created as part of the Responsive Design module of the Scrimba Front-End Career Path. The goal of this project was to practice my HTML and CSS skills, as well as to learn more about responsive design principles and techniques.

The website consists of several pages, including a home page, an about page, a blog page, and a contact page. Each page is designed to be simple and easy to navigate, with a focus on providing helpful information and resources to readers who are interested in simplifying their lives.
